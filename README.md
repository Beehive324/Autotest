## Abstract

This framework implements an advanced multi-agent system for automated penetration testing, utilizing artificial intelligence to coordinate and execute comprehensive security assessments. The system employs a hierarchical architecture with specialized agents working under the supervision of an orchestrator, enabling sophisticated security analysis and vulnerability assessment.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Orchestrator**
   - Central control unit managing agent interactions
   - State management and workflow coordination
   - Handoff management between specialized agents
   - Execution flow control

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - Reconnaissance Agent: Target scanning and information gathering
   - Vulnerability Assessment Agent: Security vulnerability analysis
   - Exploitation Agent: Vulnerability exploitation
   - Reporting Agent: Security assessment documentation
